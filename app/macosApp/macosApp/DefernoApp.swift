/// macOS app entry (ADR-0029, Phase 1b). Owns the shared component tree for the app's lifetime and
/// hands its `RootComponent` to SwiftUI. That tree is the **real** shared shell over the DI graph
/// (`DefernoRoot` — the macOS analogue of `DefernoApplication` + `MainActivity`), not the in-memory
/// `DefernoDemoRoot` scaffold: the Views render `RootComponent → Auth/Main → the Destination graph`
/// (ADR-0013/0017). The app opens on the Auth shell; a pasted staging PAT flips the Active Account and
/// the Main shell renders over the real data layer. Bridged by the hand-written SKIE-free bridge until
/// SKIE supports Kotlin 2.4.0.
